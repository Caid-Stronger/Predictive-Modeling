1. Compute a pair-wise distance matrix of all examples.
2. Represent each data point as a singleton cluster.
3. Merge the two closest clusters based on the distance between the most dissimilar (distant)
members.
4. Update the cluster linkage matrix.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until one single cluster remains.
