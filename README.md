# Predictive-Modeling


This repository documents my learning journey in the Predictive Modeling course as part of my Data Science program. It includes:

* Python code implementations of key algorithms and models

* Notes and explanations of theoretical concepts

* Hands-on projects and case studies

* Reflections on model performance and evaluation techniques

The goal is to consolidate foundational and advanced techniques in predictive analytics, including regression, classification, Decision Trees, Recommender Systems, Model Evaluation and Validaiton, Ensemble Methods, Bayesian Methods, Time Series Forecasting, and Monte Carlo Simulating.
