# Predictive-Modeling


This repository documents my learning journey in the Predictive Modeling course as part of my Data Science program. It includes:

* Python code implementations of key algorithms and models

* Notes and explanations of theoretical concepts

* Hands-on projects and case studies

* Reflections on model performance and evaluation techniques

The goal is to consolidate foundational and advanced techniques in predictive analytics, including regression, classification, feature selection, model tuning, validation, and time series.
